                                    <h3>How confidential is this service?</h3>
                                    <p>No information will be passed from your coach to any other person or organisation without your permission. </p>
                                    <p>In some cases, the coachee, coach and an organisation sponsoring the coaching may reach an agreement before coaching begins on the kind of reporting that may be provided. If this is the case, the coach will ensure this agreement is clearly understood by all parties.</p>
                                    <h3>How long will <em>right.<strong>now</strong></em> keep a copy of my work on the site once the coaching has finished?</h3>
                                    <p>Usually the site administrator will remove all details of a coachee and the work produced 30 days after the final session. However, if the coachee asks that the material remains on site for a longer period for their convenience, the administrator will be happy to respond to requests.</p>
                                    <p>Coachees may also wish to send themselves copies of resources or learning plans they have used during coaching during or at the conclusion of the coaching service. This is easy to do within the coaching app.</p>
                                    <h3>Who can set up a coaching appointment?</h3>
                                    <p>Your coach is the only person who can set up an appointment within the system. However, when you receive an invitation, you can accept, decline or send a message asking to reschedule.</p>
                                    <h3>What do I do if I need technical help with the video component of <em>right.<strong>now</strong></em>?</h3>
